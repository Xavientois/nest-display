# Nest Display

The Nest thermostat in my home is on a different floor from where I work. This means that the temperature readings might not directly correspond to the temperature in my office. To address this, I put together this small project to monitor the Nest thermostat data and the temperature in my office side by side. The Raspberry Pi reads the conditions in my office from a DHT11 Hygrothermograph and queries the Nest thermostat state from Google's API. It displays both on a two-row LCD display.
